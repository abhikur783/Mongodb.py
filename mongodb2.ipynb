    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database that is used to store, manage and retrieve unstructured and semi-structured data. \n",
    "It is a document-based database, meaning that data is stored as documents instead of tables with rows and columns, which is the case for traditional \n",
    "SQL (relational) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, like MongoDB, are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, such as documents, images, videos, and social \n",
    "media feeds. They provide greater flexibility in data modeling, which allows for faster and more efficient data retrieval. Non-relational databases \n",
    "also offer horizontal scalability, which allows for distributed database architecture to handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data being managed is unstructured and does not require complex transactional support.\n",
    "It is particularly well-suited for use cases where large amounts of data are being generated, such as in e-commerce, social media, and IoT\n",
    "(Internet of Things) applications. Additionally, MongoDB is often used in real-time analytics, content management systems, and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to SQL databases, MongoDB offers several advantages, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexible data modeling: MongoDB's document-based data model allows for flexible and dynamic data modeling, which makes it easy to modify and\n",
    "update the data schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability: MongoDB can be easily scaled horizontally, which means it can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Performance: MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data and provides fast and efficient querying capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Cost-effectiveness: MongoDB is open-source software, which makes it an affordable alternative to proprietary SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, SQL databases are still preferred in scenarios where complex transactions need to be managed, such as in financial applications, or where \n",
    "data consistency is a critical requirement. Additionally, SQL databases are still the standard choice for business intelligence and reporting\n",
    "applications.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that is known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. Here are some of the key\n",
    "features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored in documents. A document is a JSON-like data structure \n",
    "that contains field-value pairs, making it easy to store and query complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable: MongoDB is designed to be scalable, both vertically and horizontally. It can handle large volumes of data and can be easily scaled up or \n",
    "down by adding or removing nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB is designed to provide high performance even with large amounts of data. It uses a number of features to improve \n",
    "performance, such as indexing, sharding, and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: MongoDB has a flexible data model that allows for the storage of a variety of data types, including arrays, documents, and\n",
    "binary data. This makes it ideal for storing data that has changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Sharding: MongoDB can automatically distribute data across multiple nodes in a cluster, which allows for horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that allows for complex queries and aggregation operations. The query language is based \n",
    "on JavaScript, which makes it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB provides high availability through replica sets, which are groups of MongoDB instances that store the same data. If one\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "node fails, the replica set can automatically elect a new primary node to ensure continued availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports a variety of indexing options, including primary, secondary, and compound indexes. Indexes can improve query performance\n",
    "and reduce the amount of time it takes to access data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a flexible, scalable, and high-performance NoSQL database that is ideal for a wide range of applications. Its document-oriented\n",
    "data model, flexible schema, and powerful query language make it an attractive choice for developers who need to store and manage complex data."
